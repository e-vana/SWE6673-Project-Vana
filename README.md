## About
The code is written in Javascript and utilizes the NodeJS runtime, youâ€™ll need to install Node and then in your terminal navigate to the cloned repository location and run npm install.  After installing the required dependencies you can run the index.js file with the command node index.js.   This will run the code against the test cases (located in the ./tests directory) and generate a results.json file located at ./results/results.json.

## Test Results
You can look at the test results in two ways: you can look at the results.json file to look at the raw data and some test information or you can open the index.html page that reads that data and displays it in a table.
